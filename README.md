AI model for brain tumor detection using MRI and explainable AI

# MRI Brain Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.  
The model classifies images into:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

Grad-CAM visualizations are used to explain model decisions.

## Features
- MRI tumor classification
- Grad-CAM explainability
- High accuracy (~95%)
- Clean training pipeline

## Tech Stack
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab
- Grad-CAM visualization

## Results
- Training Accuracy: ~95%
- Validation Accuracy: ~95%
- Explainable AI heatmaps included
